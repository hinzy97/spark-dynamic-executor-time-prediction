# NN Execution Time Prediction

This repository contains neural network models for predicting execution time of Spark applications, based on the paper:

## ðŸ§  What It Does
The goal is to accurately predict the **total runtime** of Spark applications affected by dynamic executor behavior.
Two types of neural network models are implemented:
- **Black-box model**: Uses summary-level features (e.g., input size, total stages, executor scaling stats).
- **White-box model**: Uses detailed stage-level features including shuffle read/write, task metrics, and executor timelines.

Workloads include:

- **TPC-DS SQL queries**: Q26, Q52, Q70
- **KMeans clustering**



## Structure

- `km_nn_blackbox.txt`: NN model using blackbox features for KMeans.
- `km_nn_whitebox.txt`: NN model using whitebox features for KMeans.
- `query26_nn_blackbox.txt`: NN model using blackbox features for Query-26.
- `query26_nn_whitebox.txt`: NN model using whitebox features for Query-26.
- `q52_NN_black box.ipynb`: Blackbox NN model for Query-52
- `q52_NN_whitebox.ipynb`: Whitebox NN model for Query-52
- `q70_NN_black box.ipynb`: Blackbox NN model for Query-70
- `q70_NN_whitebox.ipynb`: Whitebox NN model for Query-70
- `kmeansdata.csv`: Input data for KMeans models.
- `query26_train_blackbox.csv`: Blackbox feature data for Query-26.
- `query26_train_whitebox.csv`: Whitebox feature data for Query-26.
- `query52train.csv`: Blackbox feature data for Query-52.
- `query52train1.csv`: Whitebox feature data for Query-52.
- `query70train.csv`: Blackbox feature data for Query-70.
- `query70train1.csv`: Whitebox feature data for Query-70.


## How to Run

1. Open a Jupyter notebook inside the `NN` folder.
2. Run the notebook to view predictions and plots.

## ðŸ”§ Future Work

- Integration with Spark UI for real-time feature extraction
- Coupling DAM with an **optimization framework** for executor recommendation
- Extending DAM for **multi-job workloads** or streaming scenarios
